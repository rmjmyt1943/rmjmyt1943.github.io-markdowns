# Types of Displays

This page describes common display technologies and where they shine.

## LCD / LED-backlit TVs and Panels
- Cost-effective, good for indoor signage and broadcast monitors.
- Pros: wide availability, good color and resolution.
- Cons: limited peak brightness compared to pro LED walls.

## LED Video Walls (Direct-view LED)
- Composed of modules with a pixel pitch (e.g., P2.5, P4) — smaller pitch = higher resolution.
- Ideal for large-scale staging and outdoor signage.
- Pros: very bright, scalable, high contrast.
- Cons: higher cost, heavier infrastructure.

## Projection (DLP / Laser)
- Good for very large images; can be rear- or front-projection.
- Requires controlled lighting conditions and a suitable screen.

## Touch / Interactive Displays
- Combine a display with a touch overlay (IR, capacitive).
- Used in kiosks, wayfinding, and interactive exhibits.

## MicroLED / OLED (Specialty)
- OLED: deep blacks and excellent contrast for small-to-medium screens.
- MicroLED: emerging tech with high brightness and long life.
