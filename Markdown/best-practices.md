# Best Practices — Installing and Driving Digital Displays

- Verify ambient lighting and choose brightness (nits) accordingly.
- Use the correct pixel pitch for viewing distance (LED walls).
- Plan cable runs, power, and ventilation early.
- Test content at native resolution to avoid scaling artifacts.
- Provide remote monitoring and an easy content update workflow (CMS).
- For interactive displays, design touch targets large enough for comfortable use.
